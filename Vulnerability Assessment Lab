# ðŸ”§ Vulnerability Assessment Lab
_A focused security project on scanning, analysing, and prioritising vulnerabilities across virtualised systems._

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This lab simulates the vulnerability management process in enterprise environments. Using Nessus Essentials, I scanned intentionally vulnerable VMs, then analysed results by severity, exposure, and exploitability. The goal was to turn raw findings into actionable intelligence â€” and present that visually through dashboards, just like in a real GRC or SOC setting.

### ðŸ§° Lab Environment Setup

**Tools & Components:**
- Tenable Nessus Essentials â€“ Vulnerability scanning
- Excel & Power BI â€“ Reporting & dashboards
- Ubuntu Server / Windows 10 VMs â€“ Target systems
- Proxmox VE â€“ Hosting environment

---

### ðŸ§  Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- Configuring and running scans in **Nessus Essentials**
- Analysing results using **CVSS** and asset criticality
- Building dashboards in **Power BI** and Excel
- Documenting vulnerabilities with **CVE references**
- Simulating re-scans after remediation steps
- Using threat intel sources like **NIST NVD** and **CISA KEV**
- Practicing vulnerability lifecycle management

---

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- How to interpret scan data beyond the surface level
- Why prioritisation matters (CVSS vs asset value vs exploitability)
- The importance of communicating findings clearly
- How real organisations track, monitor, and report vulnerability trends

### ðŸ“Ž Final Thoughts
This project helped bridge the gap between technical vulnerability discovery and actionable business risk. It also helped me understand how vulnerability data is communicated in SOCs and security teams â€” especially when working with other departments or justifying patch urgency.
